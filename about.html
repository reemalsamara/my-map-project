    <h1>About Me - Tamer Hosny</h1>



    <p>
        With a passion for real estate and a commitment to helping clients succeed, I've dedicated over 15 years to
        building strong relationships and delivering exceptional results. I began my journey in real estate after
        earning my certification in Ontario and have proudly represented clients across Mississauga, Toronto, and
        surrounding areas.
    </p>

    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>
        Starting as a local property consultant, I quickly learned that real estate is not just about buying and selling
        homes — it's about guiding families, understanding emotions, and building dreams. Over the years, I’ve worked
        with first-time buyers, investors, and sellers from diverse backgrounds.
    </p>

    <h3>Core Values</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Honest advice, always.</li>
        <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> I go above and beyond to meet client goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Using the latest tools and technology to market properties effectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
    <p>
        When I'm not working, I enjoy volunteering with community events, spending quality time with my family, and
        exploring new areas around the GTA. Real estate is my profession, but connecting with people is my passion.
